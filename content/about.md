### Theme Template

The template of this blog, [TeXtLite][TeXtLite], is inspired by [jekyll TeXt
theme][TeXt], which is the template I used before. To get more control of my
website and to make it more lightweight, I ported [TeXt][TeXt] to Hugo,
resulting in [TeXtLite][TeXtLite]. [TeXtLite][TeXtLite] is meant to be
lightweight and minimalist, in which most of the fancy features of the original
TeXt theme was pruned off.

### Landing Page

Instead of adopting **TeXt theme's landing page**, [TeXtLite][TeXtLite]'s
landing page is inspired by [Academic theme](https://academic-demo.netlify.app).
